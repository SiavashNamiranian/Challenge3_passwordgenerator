# Challenge3_passwordgenerator

## Description

This was a javascript oriented assignment where a password generator was expected, codes are written to provide prompt and alret to user and record their response on what selection of characters or letters they would like to have in their final password, written code so far handles prompts and selection of password characters but there are issues with element indeces being provided rather than actual characters.
